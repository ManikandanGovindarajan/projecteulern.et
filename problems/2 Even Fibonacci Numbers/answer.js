// Even Fibonacci Numbers

/* 
 problem content
    Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. 
    By starting with  1  and  2 , the first  10  
    terms will be: 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 55 , 89 , â€¦  
    By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
